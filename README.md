## Communication

If you see a way to improve the project :

- If you **found a bug**, _and can provide steps to reliably reproduce it_, open an [issue][].
- If you **have a feature request**, open an [issue][].
- If you **want to contribute**, submit a [pull request]. It's better to begin with an [issue][] rather than a [pull request], though, because we might disagree whether the proposed change is an actual improvement. :wink:

Thanks! :v:
